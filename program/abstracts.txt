Keynote: Amazon and the Future of the Open Cloud
Speaker: Greg DeKoenigsberg
mazon Web Services is the dominant public cloud provider in the
industry.  And for good reason: they make it dead simple to get up and
running in the cloud.  Lock-in risks in the public cloud world,
though, are enormous: what alternatives will users have if, for
whatever reason, they decide that Amazon services are no longer for
them?  How do we leverage the freedom of choice provided by open
source in a cloud world that is increasingly dominated by a single
entity?

Sunday Keynote

Using SmartOS as a Hypervisor
Speaker: Robert Mustacchi
SmartOS is an open source distribution of illumos, currently in production for Joyent's public cloud, where it provides a hypervisor that is secure, flexible and observable. It leverages technologies such as ZFS snapshots and clones for rapid provisioning, KVM and Zones for hardware and OS virtualization, and DTrace to safely understand what's going on inside of guests and the hypervisor. This talk will describe these technologies and their use, including engineering challenges encountered, and discuss opportunities for observing guests such as Linux and Windows.

Performance Analysis: New Tools and Concepts from The Cloud
Speaker: Brendan Gregg
Cloud Computing introduces new challenges for performance analysis, for both customers and operators of the cloud. Apart from monitoring a scaling environment, issues within a system can be complicated when tenants are competing for the same resources, and are invisible to each other. Other factors include rapidly changing production code and wildly unpredictable traffic surges. For performance analysis in the Joyent public cloud, we use a variety of tools including Dynamic Tracing, which allows us to create custom tools and metrics and to explore new concepts.


Installing Eucalyptus: Past, Present, and Future
Speaker: David Kavanagh
From the start, Eucalyptus has been installed using a set of instructions that walked the user through various options, from distro to hypervisor to network mode. While there is still value in that for the ultimate flexibility, there are other ways to get Eucalyptus installed. FastStart is one such technology. It uses a set of simplifying assumptions to create a POC installer. For those who want to not only provision Eucalyptus, but handle ongoing configuration management, Puppet and Silvereye can help to take things to the next level.

In this talk I will discuss my experience with the Dlink DIR-685 Wireless N router and how with just a few basic skills I was able to find multiple exploits, including one that gave me root, all through the web interface. As I describe the attacks I'll demonstrate the exploits with a live demo.


Advanced web content management with revision control
Speaker: Don Marti
The new generation of web content management systems uses a revision control system such as git, Mercurial, or Perforce, instead of a relational database, for storage. We'll cover systems such as ikiwiki, jekyll, and Perforce Chronicle, and see examples of advanced workflow enabled by revision control--while regular users see a simple wiki-like or WYSIWYG interface. We'll also learn to extend a revision-control-backed WCM system with powerful "PageSpec" expressions or ORM-like Records.


Care and Feeding of a MySQL database for Linux Administrators
Speaker: David Stokes
MySQL is the most popular database on the web. But there are relatively few qualified MySQL DBAs . This session provides a guide for Linux Admins who are looking to acquire DBA skills or have inherited servers but do not know how to care for them. Do you know your EXT2 /3 file system may be slowing you down? Do you have the right data indexed? And why you should invest in memory rather than processors.

The MySQL Storage Engines Landscape
Speaker: Colin Charles
A unique selling point of MySQL is that is supports multiple storage engines, which basically means users get to use the same top-level SQL interface while storing their data in many different sorts of methods. There is a storage engine API that was well nurtured, and a myriad of companies continuing on with creating opensource & commercial storage engines, with the API being extended in forks like MariaDB. Which engine is right for your workload? Do you choose a mix or just stick with something default like MyISAM or InnoDB? This and more will be answered in the talk.

The MySQL Diaspora
Speaker: Colin Charles
MySQL is the world's most popular open source database. It's been popular for years, and was relatively safe in the hands of MySQL AB.

This session will articulate how all of us can work together to make these collaborations better -- and more often. Finally, I'll report the latest results from the POSSE workshop that happened this summer, and that's been submitted in an intensive-version on this conference as well. Join us for the revolution!


POSSE intensive -- a cultural immersion workshop
Speaker: Sebastian Dziallas
Working in the open source world can be a daunting proposition. Not everybody has the time to learn about the means, tools and most importantly the culture this world employs. If you’re someone with skills that would benefit an open source project – developer, sysadmin, designer, writer, marketer, lawyer, tester, and nearly anything else under the sun – but have a hard time figuring out how to interact with the communities you want to work with, this workshop is for you. Originally designed for professors getting their students started as contributors, we're opening it to the public.

Getting Started with Git
Speaker: Ron Toland
Git is arguably the best version control system out there. But habits formed from years of using svn or CVS can trip you up when you switch to using git.
